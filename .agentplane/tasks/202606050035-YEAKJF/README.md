## Summary

Format TypeScript build wrapper

After the TypeScript/tsup build wrapper fix, final release prepublish failed format:check on scripts/checks/run-typescript-build.mjs. Format the wrapper, run focused format/lint/build checks, and continue release validation.

## Scope

- In scope: After the TypeScript/tsup build wrapper fix, final release prepublish failed format:check on scripts/checks/run-typescript-build.mjs. Format the wrapper, run focused format/lint/build checks, and continue release validation.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Format TypeScript build wrapper".

## Plan

1. Format run-typescript-build.mjs and run-tsup-build.mjs with Prettier. 2. Run focused Prettier check, eslint, typecheck, and build under the release Node 24 shell. 3. Record verification and evaluator evidence, then retry full release prepublish.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Format TypeScript build wrapper". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Format TypeScript build wrapper". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
