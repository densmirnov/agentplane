    Hide runner guidance outside parallel-codex context

    Default agent prompt and route surfaces must not introduce runner execution guidance unless the route is already a real runner wait/run state or the active recipe is parallel-codex. Ordinary agents should execute tasks themselves via normal AgentPlane lifecycle.
  Scope: |-
    - In scope: Default agent prompt and route surfaces must not introduce runner execution guidance unless the route is already a real runner wait/run state or the active recipe is parallel-codex. Ordinary agents should execute tasks themselves via normal AgentPlane lifecycle.
    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Hide runner guidance outside parallel-codex context".
  Plan: "1. Audit prompt and route-context surfaces that mention runner execution outside recipe-owned parallel-codex assets. 2. Remove default runner_context output from task brief/status/next-action when the current route is not runner-required or runner-allowed. 3. Reword evaluator prompt so default quality review covers task attempts and treats runner artifacts as optional evidence only when present. 4. Verify targeted tests and command output show no runner context for ordinary tasks while preserving actual runner route handling."
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Run `bun run --filter=agentplane typecheck`. Expected: exits 0.
    2. Run `bun run --filter=agentplane build`. Expected: exits 0 and refreshes the repo-local CLI bundle.
    3. Run `bun test packages/agentplane/src/commands/shared/route-guidance.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/commands/hermes/hermes.command.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.route-decision.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/runner/usecases/task-run-blueprint.test.ts`. Expected: all tests pass.
    4. Run `ap task brief 202606050513-XN7G9D`, `ap task status 202606050513-XN7G9D --route`, and `ap task next-action 202606050513-XN7G9D --explain`; inspect stdout for default runner-only context fields. Expected: ordinary task output contains none of those fields.
    5. Review `.agentplane/agents/EVALUATOR.json` and Hermes route projection behavior. Expected: runner evidence is optional and only appears when existing task runner evidence or an explicit runner route exists; ordinary agents are directed to continue owner task execution.

## Summary

Hide runner guidance outside parallel-codex context

Default agent prompt and route surfaces must not introduce runner execution guidance unless the route is already a real runner wait/run state or the active recipe is parallel-codex. Ordinary agents should execute tasks themselves via normal AgentPlane lifecycle.

## Scope

- In scope: Default agent prompt and route surfaces must not introduce runner execution guidance unless the route is already a real runner wait/run state or the active recipe is parallel-codex. Ordinary agents should execute tasks themselves via normal AgentPlane lifecycle.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Hide runner guidance outside parallel-codex context".

## Plan

1. Audit prompt and route-context surfaces that mention runner execution outside recipe-owned parallel-codex assets. 2. Remove default runner_context output from task brief/status/next-action when the current route is not runner-required or runner-allowed. 3. Reword evaluator prompt so default quality review covers task attempts and treats runner artifacts as optional evidence only when present. 4. Verify targeted tests and command output show no runner context for ordinary tasks while preserving actual runner route handling.

## Verify Steps

1. Run `bun run --filter=agentplane typecheck`. Expected: exits 0.
2. Run `bun run --filter=agentplane build`. Expected: exits 0 and refreshes the repo-local CLI bundle.
3. Run `bun test packages/agentplane/src/commands/shared/route-guidance.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/commands/hermes/hermes.command.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.route-decision.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/runner/usecases/task-run-blueprint.test.ts`. Expected: all tests pass.
4. Run `ap task brief 202606050513-XN7G9D`, `ap task status 202606050513-XN7G9D --route`, and `ap task next-action 202606050513-XN7G9D --explain`; inspect stdout for default runner-only context fields. Expected: ordinary task output contains none of those fields.
5. Review `.agentplane/agents/EVALUATOR.json` and Hermes route projection behavior. Expected: runner evidence is optional and only appears when existing task runner evidence or an explicit runner route exists; ordinary agents are directed to continue owner task execution.
