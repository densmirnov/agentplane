## Summary

Add structured feedback issue triage

Add an AgentPlane insights triage command and integrate it with feedback issue creation so agents can include privacy-bounded diagnostic findings while still providing their own required agent analysis.

## Scope

- In scope: Add an AgentPlane insights triage command and integrate it with feedback issue creation so agents can include privacy-bounded diagnostic findings while still providing their own required agent analysis.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Add structured feedback issue triage".

## Plan

Implement a privacy-bounded insights triage surface for feedback issues. Scope: add an insights triage subcommand with at least a startup-routing preset, add insights issue --triage <preset> integration that appends structured triage while preserving the required agent-written context for E_INTERNAL, update command docs/help generation as needed, and add focused tests for triage output and issue dry-run rendering. Verify with targeted insights tests, CLI help/docs generation checks if affected, ap task verify-show, and routing validation.

## Verify Steps

1. Run `bunx vitest --config vitest.workspace.ts run --project cli-core packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.insights-report.test.ts`. Expected: insights report, triage, and issue dry-run tests pass.
2. Run `bunx vitest --config vitest.workspace.ts run --project cli-core packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.help-contract.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.help-snap.test.ts`. Expected: help catalog and snapshots pass with insights triage listed.
3. Run `bun run docs:cli:check`. Expected: generated CLI reference remains fresh.
4. Run `bun run typecheck`. Expected: TypeScript project build succeeds.
5. Run `node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs`. Expected: policy routing remains valid.
