  Scope: |-
    - In scope: Make additional AgentPlane route and lifecycle diagnostics less ambiguous for agents: surface PR artifact freshness loops, hook-related local command risk, and actionable next commands in machine-readable CLI output.
    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Clarify confusing agent route diagnostics".
  Plan: "Extend agent-facing decision context on the existing diagnostics branch without changing lifecycle semantics: keep operator_guidance, add source/freshness/repeat/fallback/runner fields, surface them in task brief/status/next-action/pr check/runner bootstrap/verification details/errors, and cover the behavior with focused tests and CLI smoke checks."
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Run TypeScript compile for agentplane source. Expected: no type errors.
    2. Run focused regression tests for route guidance, runner bootstrap, and commit diagnostics. Expected: all selected tests pass.
    3. Run formatting, diff, and policy routing checks. Expected: no formatting, whitespace, or policy routing errors.
    4. Run CLI smoke for task next-action, task status --route, task brief, and pr check. Expected: decision context exposes source_of_truth, repeat_policy, runner_context, safe_command, and diagnostic_command without stale or contradictory fields.

      Resolution: Added shared route guidance derivation, surfaced it in CLI outputs, and covered the behavior with focused tests plus CLI smoke checks.

    - Observation: Route guidance now exposes source of truth, freshness, repeat policy, fallback, and runner rail context across task next-action, task status --route, task brief, pr check, runner bootstrap, verification records, and commit diagnostics.
      Impact: Agents have explicit execute/diagnose/wait/stop context and should be less likely to repeat stale PR updates, confuse hook wrapper failures with source failures, or introduce runner execution outside the active route.
      Resolution: Added shared derived decision context and regression tests; PR check remains the diagnostic command when route asks for PR artifact updates.

    - Observation: Removed unnecessary exports from internal route-guidance helper types that triggered the knip unused-code baseline guard.
      Impact: Static CI should no longer fail on exported-but-unused type aliases while preserving the decision context JSON shape.
      Resolution: Validated with bun run knip:check, tsc, and focused vitest before updating PR artifacts.

## Summary

Clarify confusing agent route diagnostics

Make additional AgentPlane route and lifecycle diagnostics less ambiguous for agents: surface PR artifact freshness loops, hook-related local command risk, and actionable next commands in machine-readable CLI output.

## Scope

- In scope: Make additional AgentPlane route and lifecycle diagnostics less ambiguous for agents: surface PR artifact freshness loops, hook-related local command risk, and actionable next commands in machine-readable CLI output.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Clarify confusing agent route diagnostics".

## Plan

Extend agent-facing decision context on the existing diagnostics branch without changing lifecycle semantics: keep operator_guidance, add source/freshness/repeat/fallback/runner fields, surface them in task brief/status/next-action/pr check/runner bootstrap/verification details/errors, and cover the behavior with focused tests and CLI smoke checks.

## Verify Steps

1. Run TypeScript compile for agentplane source. Expected: no type errors.
2. Run focused regression tests for route guidance, runner bootstrap, and commit diagnostics. Expected: all selected tests pass.
3. Run formatting, diff, and policy routing checks. Expected: no formatting, whitespace, or policy routing errors.
4. Run CLI smoke for task next-action, task status --route, task brief, and pr check. Expected: decision context exposes source_of_truth, repeat_policy, runner_context, safe_command, and diagnostic_command without stale or contradictory fields.
