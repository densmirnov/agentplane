    Scope: improve commit hook failure diagnostics encountered during task 202606042157-020DWK.

    Plan:
    1. Locate commit hook diagnostic classification for commit subject format and DCO sign-off failures.
    2. Replace generic git_context reason metadata with action-specific reason_code/reason_action/next_action guidance where possible.
    3. Add focused tests for invalid subject and missing DCO outputs.
    4. Verify with focused commit diagnostic tests, typecheck, and live/fixture output checks if available.
    5. Include this task in PR #4442 batch before release work continues.
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Run focused commit diagnostics tests. Expected: invalid commit subject and missing DCO failures emit action-specific reason_code, reason_action, and next_action instead of generic git_context guidance.
    2. Run agentplane typecheck. Expected: no TypeScript regressions in commit diagnostics code.
    3. Inspect the diff for hook-output ambiguity. Expected: every changed diagnostic tells the agent exactly what to fix before retrying commit.

## Summary

Make commit hook failures action-specific

Refactor commit hook diagnostics so commit subject and DCO failures return action-specific reason codes and next actions instead of generic git_context guidance.

## Scope

- In scope: Refactor commit hook diagnostics so commit subject and DCO failures return action-specific reason codes and next actions instead of generic git_context guidance.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Make commit hook failures action-specific".

## Plan

Scope: improve commit hook failure diagnostics encountered during task 202606042157-020DWK.

Plan:
1. Locate commit hook diagnostic classification for commit subject format and DCO sign-off failures.
2. Replace generic git_context reason metadata with action-specific reason_code/reason_action/next_action guidance where possible.
3. Add focused tests for invalid subject and missing DCO outputs.
4. Verify with focused commit diagnostic tests, typecheck, and live/fixture output checks if available.
5. Include this task in PR #4442 batch before release work continues.

## Verify Steps

1. Run focused commit diagnostics tests. Expected: invalid commit subject and missing DCO failures emit action-specific reason_code, reason_action, and next_action instead of generic git_context guidance.
2. Run agentplane typecheck. Expected: no TypeScript regressions in commit diagnostics code.
3. Inspect the diff for hook-output ambiguity. Expected: every changed diagnostic tells the agent exactly what to fix before retrying commit.
