## Summary

Format release ACR example after version bump

After the v0.6.17 release candidate commit, bun run release:prepublish:heavy failed format:check because packages/spec/examples/acr.json was not Prettier-formatted. Format the generated ACR example, verify the release gates, and continue release publication.

## Scope

- In scope: After the v0.6.17 release candidate commit, bun run release:prepublish:heavy failed format:check because packages/spec/examples/acr.json was not Prettier-formatted. Format the generated ACR example, verify the release gates, and continue release publication.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Format release ACR example after version bump".

## Plan

1. Confirm format:check fails only on packages/spec/examples/acr.json after the release version bump. 2. Format that JSON artifact with the repository formatter. 3. Run the focused format check and ACR example check. 4. Record verification/evaluator evidence, then resume the full release prepublish gate.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Format release ACR example after version bump". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Format release ACR example after version bump". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
