## Summary

Fix GitHub issue #4412 by making runner result manifest handling accept an externally blocked delegated run instead of rejecting it as an internal invalid_result_manifest error.

## Scope

In scope: runner result manifest schema/parsing, terminal status mapping for blocked external publication or policy cases, and focused tests covering status=blocked. Out of scope: GitHub permission repair, Codex auth changes, broad runner lifecycle refactors, release publication.

## Plan

1. Locate runner result manifest status validation and terminal status mapping.
2. Add blocked as an accepted delegated-run terminal result or map it to the existing first-class external blocked state without raising invalid_result_manifest.
3. Add a focused regression test for a result manifest with status=blocked.
4. Run the targeted test, policy routing check, and declared task verification.

## Verify Steps

1. Run the focused runner manifest test that covers status=blocked.
2. Run the relevant package test suite for the touched runner module if separate from the focused test.
3. Run node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs.
4. Run ap task verify-show 202606032048-TXNN46 before recording verification.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the implementation and test commits for this task; runner manifest validation returns to the previous accepted status set.

## Findings

- Observation: Repeated Vitest invocations after package build hung before printing a banner; killed only those local test processes and used package typecheck plus direct bun parser smoke as supplementary evidence.
  Impact: The regression had already passed in the initial focused Vitest run; local post-build Vitest startup hang is recorded as residual harness risk, not a parser failure.
  Resolution: Direct smoke readRunnerResultManifest status=blocked passed and package typechecks/schema/routing passed.
