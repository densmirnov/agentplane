## Summary

Make hosted-close tolerate pre-merge closed tasks

Post-merge hosted-close failed after PR #4439 because the task was already DONE in the merged PR with a close commit that is an ancestor of the GitHub merge commit. Treat that state as an idempotent noop when the PR metadata matches the merged task branch/number and the recorded DONE commit is reachable from the merge commit.

## Scope

- In scope: Post-merge hosted-close failed after PR #4439 because the task was already DONE in the merged PR with a close commit that is an ancestor of the GitHub merge commit. Treat that state as an idempotent noop when the PR metadata matches the merged task branch/number and the recorded DONE commit is reachable from the merge commit.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Make hosted-close tolerate pre-merge closed tasks".

## Plan

1. Reproduce the hosted-close conflict path with a regression test where a task is DONE before the merged PR event and its recorded close commit is an ancestor of the merge commit. 2. Update hosted-close conflict handling to return a noop for that verified pre-merge closure state while keeping unrelated conflicting DONE commits blocked. 3. Verify targeted hosted-close tests plus policy/type checks needed for this workflow slice. 4. Publish and merge the follow-up PR.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Make hosted-close tolerate pre-merge closed tasks". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Make hosted-close tolerate pre-merge closed tasks". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
