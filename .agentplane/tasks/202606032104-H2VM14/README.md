    - In scope: Investigate why quickstart reports a branch_pr route in a direct workflow repo, implement the smallest coherent fix, and verify with targeted CLI checks.
    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Fix upstream issue 4406 quickstart direct route".
  Plan: "1. Reproduce the quickstart output for a direct-workflow fixture and trace where the route text is chosen. 2.

Run targeted quickstart/config tests plus the required routing/doctor checks, then record evidence in the task artifact."
  Verify Steps: "1. Reproduce the bug by running the repo-local quickstart command in a direct-workflow fixture and confirm the route text is wrong before the fix. Expected: quickstart incorrectly mentions branch_pr despite direct workflow configuration. 2. Re-run the same direct-workflow quickstart path after the fix. Expected: the route guidance now matches direct workflow commands only. 3. Run targeted tests for the touched quickstart/config code plus required repository checks. Expected: targeted tests pass, ✅ doctor (OK) passes, and policy routing OK passes."

    - Observation: Targeted quickstart CLI tests could not be executed in this session because the framework worktree is not bootstrapped and the required bun runtime is unavailable in the environment.
      Impact: Verification is limited to source inspection plus ap doctor and node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs, so runtime-level regression coverage for the edited quickstart copy remains unconfirmed here.
      Resolution: Run bun run framework:dev:bootstrap, then execute the targeted AgentPlane CLI tests covering packages/agentplane/src/cli/command-guide.test.ts and packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.branch-meta.readiness.test.ts before merge or release.

## Summary

Fix upstream issue 4406 quickstart direct route

Investigate why quickstart reports a branch_pr route in a direct workflow repo, implement the smallest coherent fix, and verify with targeted CLI checks.

## Scope

- In scope: Investigate why quickstart reports a branch_pr route in a direct workflow repo, implement the smallest coherent fix, and verify with targeted CLI checks.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Fix upstream issue 4406 quickstart direct route".

## Plan

1. Reproduce the quickstart output for a direct-workflow fixture and trace where the route text is chosen. 2. Apply the smallest fix so quickstart prints the repo's actual configured workflow route. 3. Run targeted quickstart/config tests plus the required routing/doctor checks, then record evidence in the task artifact.

## Verify Steps

1. Reproduce the bug by running the repo-local quickstart command in a direct-workflow fixture and confirm the route text is wrong before the fix. Expected: quickstart incorrectly mentions branch_pr despite direct workflow configuration. 2. Re-run the same direct-workflow quickstart path after the fix.

- Observation: Targeted quickstart CLI tests could not be executed in this session because the framework worktree is not bootstrapped and the required bun runtime is unavailable in the environment.
  Impact: Verification is limited to source inspection plus ap doctor and node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs, so runtime-level regression coverage for the edited quickstart copy remains unconfirmed here.
