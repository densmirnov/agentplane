  Scope: |-
    - In scope: Add a bounded timeout and actionable diagnostics around repository-managed git commit operations so hook finalization hangs do not leave agents without a next step.
    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Bound git commit hook hangs".
  Plan: |-
    Scope: prevent repository-managed git commit operations from hanging indefinitely after hook checks.

    Plan:
    1. Add a bounded timeout to the AgentPlane git commit runner path.
    2. Surface timeout as hook/finalization infrastructure evidence with a concrete next_action and reason_code.
    3. Add focused unit coverage for timeout classification.
    4. Verify with commit runner/diagnostics tests and typecheck.
    5. Include this task in PR #4442 batch before any patch release work.
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Run focused commit runner diagnostics tests. Expected: timed-out git commit operations return E_GIT with a commit-timeout reason code and concrete next_action instead of hanging silently.
    2. Run commit diagnostics tests. Expected: subject, DCO, formatter, and timeout diagnostics remain action-specific.
    3. Run agentplane typecheck. Expected: no TypeScript regressions in commit runner or diagnostic context code.

## Summary

Bound git commit hook hangs

Add a bounded timeout and actionable diagnostics around repository-managed git commit operations so hook finalization hangs do not leave agents without a next step.

## Scope

- In scope: Add a bounded timeout and actionable diagnostics around repository-managed git commit operations so hook finalization hangs do not leave agents without a next step.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Bound git commit hook hangs".

## Plan

Scope: prevent repository-managed git commit operations from hanging indefinitely after hook checks.

Plan:
1. Add a bounded timeout to the AgentPlane git commit runner path.
2. Surface timeout as hook/finalization infrastructure evidence with a concrete next_action and reason_code.
3. Add focused unit coverage for timeout classification.
4. Verify with commit runner/diagnostics tests and typecheck.
5. Include this task in PR #4442 batch before any patch release work.

## Verify Steps

1. Run focused commit runner diagnostics tests. Expected: timed-out git commit operations return E_GIT with a commit-timeout reason code and concrete next_action instead of hanging silently.
2. Run commit diagnostics tests. Expected: subject, DCO, formatter, and timeout diagnostics remain action-specific.
