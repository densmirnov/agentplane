    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Bound repository pre-push runner hangs".

## Summary

Bound repository pre-push runner hangs

Prevent repository-local pre-push hook scripts from leaving git push without a clear next action when the script stops making progress.

## Scope

- In scope: Prevent repository-local pre-push hook scripts from leaving git push without a clear next action when the script stops making progress.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Bound repository pre-push runner hangs".

## Plan

Add a bounded timeout for repository-local pre-push runner scripts, emit a concrete pre-push blocked diagnostic on timeout, cover it with a focused hook runtime test, then include the task in the existing cognitive-load PR batch.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Bound repository pre-push runner hangs". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Bound repository pre-push runner hangs". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
