      Verified: 202605221745-8BHZSX is a bookkeeping duplicate of 202605230332-RYW28Y (Route agent context guidance through task brief); no code/config changes are expected in this task and closure is recorded as no-op.

      Reason: Covered by RYW28Y, which updated the installed quickstart, role guidance, generated bootstrap docs, and onboarding checks through task active/task brief.
