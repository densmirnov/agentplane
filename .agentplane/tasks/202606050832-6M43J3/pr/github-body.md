Title: Recognize legacy pre-merge closure markers after rebase merge
Canonical task record: `.agentplane/tasks/202606050832-6M43J3/README.md`

## Summary

Recognize legacy pre-merge closure markers after rebase merge

Hosted-close must no-op for DONE tasks whose pre_merge_closure marker was written before PR numbers were persisted and whose basis commit was the pre-finish branch head, not task.commit.hash. Also make finish pre-merge closure persist pr_number when PR metadata already knows it, so future hosted-close decisions are direct.

## Scope

- In scope: Hosted-close must no-op for DONE tasks whose pre_merge_closure marker was written before PR numbers were persisted and whose basis commit was the pre-finish branch head, not task.commit.hash. Also make finish pre-merge closure persist pr_number when PR metadata already knows it, so future hosted-close decisions are direct.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Recognize legacy pre-merge closure markers after rebase merge".
