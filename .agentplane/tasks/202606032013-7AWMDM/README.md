    - In scope: Implement a compact execution packet and clearer wait/provider boundaries so Hermes, OpenClaw, and custom agents can follow AgentPlane route decisions without reconstructing state from docs.
    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Strengthen external agent execution packets".
  Plan: |-
    Summary
    Implement a compact external-agent execution packet on top of the existing route oracle, clarify wait/provider action kinds, and surface the packet in task next-action, task brief, runner bootstrap, and Hermes projections.

    Scope
    - Route oracle execution packet model and derivation.
    - task next-action / task brief text and JSON surfaces.
    - Runner bootstrap guidance for custom/Hermes/OpenClaw-style adapters.
    - Hermes route packet projection.
    - Focused tests for wait/provider classification and packet rendering.

    Plan
    1. Extend RouteExecutionPacket with explicit execution_packet fields: must_run_from, exact_argv, must_not, return_control_when, human_provider_action, stale_state_check.
    2. Fix actionKind classification so wait states are distinct from terminal stop/provider actions.
    3. Render the packet compactly in CLI text surfaces and runner bootstrap.
    4. Include the same packet in Hermes projections so external supervisors do not infer authority boundaries from prose.
    5. Add/update focused tests and run targeted verification.

    Verify Steps
    - bun test packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.route-decision.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/runner/usecases/task-run-bootstrap.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/commands/hermes/hermes.command.test.ts
    - node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs
    - ap doctor

    Verification
    Pending.

    Rollback Plan
    Revert the task branch commit; route oracle and existing Hermes/custom surfaces return to the previous schema and rendering.

    Findings
    None yet.
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Run focused route/Hermes/bootstrap tests:
       `bun test packages/agentplane/src/commands/shared/route-oracle.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.route-decision.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/runner/usecases/task-run-blueprint.test.ts packages/agentplane/src/commands/hermes/hermes.command.test.ts`
       Expected: all tests pass.
    2. Run routing policy validation:
       `node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs`
       Expected: policy routing OK.
    3. Run patch hygiene:
       `git diff --check`
       Expected: no whitespace errors.
    4. Attempt repo-local health check:
       `ap doctor`
       Expected: either succeeds, or any stale-dist/bootstrap blocker is recorded explicitly in Verification.

## Summary

Strengthen external agent execution packets

Implement a compact execution packet and clearer wait/provider boundaries so Hermes, OpenClaw, and custom agents can follow AgentPlane route decisions without reconstructing state from docs.

## Scope

- In scope: Implement a compact execution packet and clearer wait/provider boundaries so Hermes, OpenClaw, and custom agents can follow AgentPlane route decisions without reconstructing state from docs.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Strengthen external agent execution packets".

## Plan

Summary
Implement a compact external-agent execution packet on top of the existing route oracle, clarify wait/provider action kinds, and surface the packet in task next-action, task brief, runner bootstrap, and Hermes projections.

Scope
- Route oracle execution packet model and derivation.
- task next-action / task brief text and JSON surfaces.
- Runner bootstrap guidance for custom/Hermes/OpenClaw-style adapters.
- Hermes route packet projection.
- Focused tests for wait/provider classification and packet rendering.

Plan
1. Extend RouteExecutionPacket with explicit execution_packet fields: must_run_from, exact_argv, must_not, return_control_when, human_provider_action, stale_state_check.
2. Fix actionKind classification so wait states are distinct from terminal stop/provider actions.
3. Render the packet compactly in CLI text surfaces and runner bootstrap.
4. Include the same packet in Hermes projections so external supervisors do not infer authority boundaries from prose.
5. Add/update focused tests and run targeted verification.

- node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs
- ap doctor

Verification
