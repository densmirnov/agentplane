    Add actionable local fallback for unavailable task backends

    Investigate and fix the local recovery path for unavailable or unsupported task backends in AgentPlane. Primary target: issue #4418. Also evaluate whether the same fix subsumes the cloud 502 fallback gap reported in #4405 without widening scope unnecessarily.
  Scope: |-
    - In scope: Investigate and fix the local recovery path for unavailable or unsupported task backends in AgentPlane. Primary target: issue #4418. Also evaluate whether the same fix subsumes the cloud 502 fallback gap reported in #4405 without widening scope unnecessarily.
    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Add actionable local fallback for unavailable task backends".
  Plan: "Investigate the task-backend loader and backend error guidance so unavailable or unsupported backends surface a concrete local recovery path instead of a generic backend failure.

  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Reproduce or inspect the current unavailable-backend path through the task backend loader and the surfaced CLI guidance. Expected: unsupported or unavailable backends currently collapse into a generic backend failure without a concrete local recovery route.
    2. Apply the bounded fix and run focused checks for the touched backend-loading and CLI guidance paths. Expected: the operator now gets an explicit local fallback or repair path for the unavailable-backend case, and the same behavior remains coherent for the cloud-backend-unavailable case when applicable.
    3. Run repository safety checks and record any residual gaps. Expected: node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs passes, ap doctor remains OK aside from known bootstrap warnings, and any skipped runtime tests are explicitly recorded in Verification/Findings.

## Summary

Add actionable local fallback for unavailable task backends

Investigate and fix the local recovery path for unavailable or unsupported task backends in AgentPlane. Primary target: issue #4418. Also evaluate whether the same fix subsumes the cloud 502 fallback gap reported in #4405 without widening scope unnecessarily.

## Scope

- In scope: Investigate and fix the local recovery path for unavailable or unsupported task backends in AgentPlane. Primary target: issue #4418. Also evaluate whether the same fix subsumes the cloud 502 fallback gap reported in #4405 without widening scope unnecessarily.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Add actionable local fallback for unavailable task backends".

## Plan

Investigate the task-backend loader and backend error guidance so unavailable or unsupported backends surface a concrete local recovery path instead of a generic backend failure. Keep scope bounded to actionable operator fallback and classification for #4418, and only absorb #4405 where the same fix naturally covers cloud-backend unavailability without expanding into backend service remediation.

## Verify Steps

1. Reproduce or inspect the current unavailable-backend path through the task backend loader and the surfaced CLI guidance. Expected: unsupported or unavailable backends currently collapse into a generic backend failure without a concrete local recovery route.
2. Apply the bounded fix and run focused checks for the touched backend-loading and CLI guidance paths. Expected: the operator now gets an explicit local fallback or repair path for the unavailable-backend case, and the same behavior remains coherent for the cloud-backend-unavailable case when applicable.
3. Run repository safety checks and record any residual gaps. Expected: node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs passes, ap doctor remains OK aside from known bootstrap warnings, and any skipped runtime tests are explicitly recorded in Verification/Findings.

## Verification

<!-- BEGIN VERIFICATION RESULTS -->
- OK `node scripts/checks/dev-impact.mjs --json`
- OK `node scripts/checks/check-task-scope.mjs --task-id 202606032122-5NZZTN`
- OK `git diff --check`
- OK `node .agentplane/policy/check-routing.mjs`
- OK `ap doctor` (passed with known framework bootstrap warning and unrelated historical DONE-task commit warnings)
- NOT RUN `bun`/Vitest-focused suites (`bun run format:changed`, `bun run ci:local:fast`, targeted vitest files) because this checkout is not bootstrapped in the current environment (`bun` missing; no workspace install present)
<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

- Revert task-related commit(s).
- Re-run required checks to confirm rollback safety.

## Findings

- Issue #4405 is incidentally covered by the same bounded fix: cloud-unavailable `E_BACKEND` guidance now points operators to inspect backend config and use the repo-local fallback when `.agentplane/tasks` is authoritative enough.
- Scope intentionally stayed out of backend-service remediation; this change only improves loader and CLI recovery guidance.
