## Summary

Subsegment agentplane dependency cruiser check

The final v0.6.17 prepublish gate still hit SIGKILL in dependency-cruiser for the largest packages/agentplane/src segment. Split the agentplane dependency-cruiser roots into smaller stable slices while preserving the same dependency rules, then rerun arch and release gates.

## Scope

- In scope: The final v0.6.17 prepublish gate still hit SIGKILL in dependency-cruiser for the largest packages/agentplane/src segment. Split the agentplane dependency-cruiser roots into smaller stable slices while preserving the same dependency rules, then rerun arch and release gates.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Subsegment agentplane dependency cruiser check".

## Plan

1. Confirm dependency-cruiser still dies on the largest packages/agentplane/src segment during final prepublish. 2. Split the agentplane package check into smaller top-level source slices while preserving the same config, include-only, ignore-known, and exclude arguments. 3. Regenerate scripts docs if command metadata changes. 4. Run arch:deps, arch:check, scripts docs check, lint/knip for the runner, then record verification and retry full prepublish.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Subsegment agentplane dependency cruiser check". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Subsegment agentplane dependency cruiser check". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
