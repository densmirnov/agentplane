## Summary

Align PR check with live-head artifacts

Make pr check treat live-head PR artifacts consistently with route oracle instead of failing with recorded_head=<live> when local artifacts are otherwise fresh.

## Scope

- In scope: Make pr check treat live-head PR artifacts consistently with route oracle instead of failing with recorded_head=<live> when local artifacts are otherwise fresh.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Align PR check with live-head artifacts".

## Plan

Update PR artifact snapshot freshness so missing meta.head_sha means live-head artifacts and does not fail stale checks when the snapshot is otherwise current; add a focused test for recorded_head=<live> behavior.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Align PR check with live-head artifacts". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Align PR check with live-head artifacts". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
