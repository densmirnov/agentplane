## Summary

Update release build contract for TypeScript wrapper

After replacing package build scripts with process-bound TypeScript wrappers, release-ci-contract still asserts the old literal 'tsc -b --force'. Update the contract to require clean plus run-typescript-build --force so it preserves the publishable clean-build invariant without forcing the unstable shim.

## Scope

- In scope: After replacing package build scripts with process-bound TypeScript wrappers, release-ci-contract still asserts the old literal 'tsc -b --force'. Update the contract to require clean plus run-typescript-build --force so it preserves the publishable clean-build invariant without forcing the unstable shim.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Update release build contract for TypeScript wrapper".

## Plan

1. Update release-ci-contract to assert npm run clean plus run-typescript-build --force for the publishable agentplane build. 2. Run the failing release contract test/chunk through the process-bound Vitest runner. 3. Record verification/evaluator evidence, then resume release-ci-base/full prepublish.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Update release build contract for TypeScript wrapper". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Update release build contract for TypeScript wrapper". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
