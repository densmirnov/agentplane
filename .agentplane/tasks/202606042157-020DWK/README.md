    Reduce agent cognitive load and publish next patch

    Refactor current CLI context surfaces so agents receive direct next-step guidance, verify route/brief/diagnostic output, then prepare and publish the next patch release.
  Scope: |-
    - In scope: Refactor current CLI context surfaces so agents receive direct next-step guidance, verify route/brief/diagnostic output, then prepare and publish the next patch release.
    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Reduce agent cognitive load and publish next patch".
  Plan: |-
    Scope: reduce agent cognitive load in CLI context surfaces and ship the next patch release.

    Plan:
    1. Audit current agent-facing CLI surfaces: quickstart, role output, task brief, task next-action, PR/check diagnostics, runner handoff context, and release next-action.
    2. Identify remaining ambiguity where output lacks one exact next command, source-of-truth labels, stop rules, or recovery guidance.
    3. Refactor the narrow shared CLI/context code paths to make next-step packets more direct while preserving branch_pr lifecycle semantics.
    4. Add focused tests that assert direct command guidance, no stale-route ambiguity, and clear release/PR handoff context.
    5. Verify with task verify-show, focused tests, typecheck/build/policy routing, and selected end-to-end CLI readbacks.
    6. Open and merge the branch_pr task PR, then generate the patch release candidate, merge it, dispatch publish, and verify GitHub/npm/tag release truth.
  Verify Steps: |-
    1. Run focused route packet tests. Expected: hybrid verify_or_update_pr routes keep recommended_role=CODER, verification_candidate=agentplane pr check <task-id>, and PR freshness guidance remains non-repeatable.
    2. Build the agentplane CLI package. Expected: TypeScript declarations and bundled CLI dist are regenerated without build errors.
    3. Run live task next-action and task brief readbacks for this task. Expected: text output includes recommended_role=CODER, diagnostic_command=agentplane pr check <task-id>, evidence_missing=verification_record, exact_argv, return_control_when, and stale_state_check.
    4. Run routing policy and relevant static checks. Expected: no policy or type regressions in touched CLI route surfaces.
    5. Complete branch_pr PR merge and release workflow. Expected: next patch tag, GitHub release, and npm package version are externally verified.

## Summary

Reduce agent cognitive load and publish next patch

Refactor current CLI context surfaces so agents receive direct next-step guidance, verify route/brief/diagnostic output, then prepare and publish the next patch release.

## Scope

- In scope: Refactor current CLI context surfaces so agents receive direct next-step guidance, verify route/brief/diagnostic output, then prepare and publish the next patch release.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Reduce agent cognitive load and publish next patch".

## Plan

Scope: reduce agent cognitive load in CLI context surfaces and ship the next patch release.

Plan:
1. Audit current agent-facing CLI surfaces: quickstart, role output, task brief, task next-action, PR/check diagnostics, runner handoff context, and release next-action.
2. Identify remaining ambiguity where output lacks one exact next command, source-of-truth labels, stop rules, or recovery guidance.
3. Refactor the narrow shared CLI/context code paths to make next-step packets more direct while preserving branch_pr lifecycle semantics.
4. Add focused tests that assert direct command guidance, no stale-route ambiguity, and clear release/PR handoff context.
5. Verify with task verify-show, focused tests, typecheck/build/policy routing, and selected end-to-end CLI readbacks.
6. Open and merge the branch_pr task PR, then generate the patch release candidate, merge it, dispatch publish, and verify GitHub/npm/tag release truth.

## Verify Steps

1. Run focused route packet tests. Expected: hybrid verify_or_update_pr routes keep recommended_role=CODER, verification_candidate=agentplane pr check <task-id>, and PR freshness guidance remains non-repeatable.
2. Build the agentplane CLI package. Expected: TypeScript declarations and bundled CLI dist are regenerated without build errors.
3. Run live task next-action and task brief readbacks for this task. Expected: text output includes recommended_role=CODER, diagnostic_command=agentplane pr check <task-id>, evidence_missing=verification_record, exact_argv, return_control_when, and stale_state_check.
4. Run routing policy and relevant static checks. Expected: no policy or type regressions in touched CLI route surfaces.
5. Complete branch_pr PR merge and release workflow. Expected: next patch tag, GitHub release, and npm package version are externally verified.
