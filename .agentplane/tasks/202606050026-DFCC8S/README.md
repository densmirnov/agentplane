    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Make knip baseline failures diagnostic".
  Plan: "1. Reproduce the opaque check-knip-baseline failure under the release Node 24 shell. 2. Update the wrapper to report status, signal, spawn error, and stderr/stdout when knip terminates. 3. If the failure is resource-related, add a stable child-process heap default like the dependency-cruiser runner. 4. Run the focused knip check and full release prepublish gate before publication continues."

## Summary

Make knip baseline failures diagnostic

Final v0.6.17 prepublish now passes dependency-cruiser but check-knip-baseline reports only 'knip exited with code unknown'. Preserve signal/error diagnostics and stabilize the knip baseline check so agents can distinguish resource termination from unused-code drift.

## Scope

- In scope: Final v0.6.17 prepublish now passes dependency-cruiser but check-knip-baseline reports only 'knip exited with code unknown'. Preserve signal/error diagnostics and stabilize the knip baseline check so agents can distinguish resource termination from unused-code drift.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Make knip baseline failures diagnostic".

## Plan

1. Reproduce the opaque check-knip-baseline failure under the release Node 24 shell. 2. Update the wrapper to report status, signal, spawn error, and stderr/stdout when knip terminates. 3. If the failure is resource-related, add a stable child-process heap default like the dependency-cruiser runner. 4. Run the focused knip check and full release prepublish gate before publication continues.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Make knip baseline failures diagnostic". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Make knip baseline failures diagnostic". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
