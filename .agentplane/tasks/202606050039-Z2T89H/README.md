## Summary

Run release Vitest suite through active Node

Final prepublish now reaches release-ci-base but run-vitest-suite launches bunx vitest and the first chunk is killed with SIGKILL. Direct node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs passes the same chunk. Update the suite runner to use the active Node process and keep signal-aware diagnostics.

## Scope

- In scope: Final prepublish now reaches release-ci-base but run-vitest-suite launches bunx vitest and the first chunk is killed with SIGKILL. Direct node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs passes the same chunk. Update the suite runner to use the active Node process and keep signal-aware diagnostics.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Run release Vitest suite through active Node".

## Plan

1. Confirm direct node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs passes the release-ci-base chunk that bunx killed. 2. Update run-vitest-suite to use the local Vitest entrypoint through process.execPath, preserving bunx fallback. 3. Run focused release-ci-base chunk coverage through the runner plus eslint/format checks. 4. Record verification/evaluator evidence, then retry full release prepublish.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Run release Vitest suite through active Node". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Run release Vitest suite through active Node". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
