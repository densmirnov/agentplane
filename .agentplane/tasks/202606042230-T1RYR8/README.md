    - Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Bound PR artifact amend hook hangs".

## Summary

Bound PR artifact amend hook hangs

Prevent PR artifact update from hanging indefinitely when git commit --amend waits on local hooks after artifacts were refreshed.

## Scope

- In scope: Prevent PR artifact update from hanging indefinitely when git commit --amend waits on local hooks after artifacts were refreshed.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Bound PR artifact amend hook hangs".

## Plan

Add timeout support to git commit --amend no-edit, use it from PR artifact auto-commit and close-refresh amend paths, and cover PR artifact amend timeout propagation with a focused unit test.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Bound PR artifact amend hook hangs". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Bound PR artifact amend hook hangs". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
