## Summary

Restore stale review metadata PR check

Fix pr check so stale review metadata relative to branch diffstat is still rejected while live-head artifact handling remains aligned.

## Scope

- In scope: Fix pr check so stale review metadata relative to branch diffstat is still rejected while live-head artifact handling remains aligned.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Restore stale review metadata PR check".

## Plan

Fix PR artifact freshness so missing meta.head_sha can be treated as live-head only when review metadata itself is fresh; stale review metadata relative to branch diffstat must still fail pr check. Verify with packages/agentplane/src/cli/run-cli.core.pr-flow.pr-notes-verify.test.ts and the freshness unit tests.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Restore stale review metadata PR check". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Restore stale review metadata PR check". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
