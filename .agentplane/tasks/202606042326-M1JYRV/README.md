## Summary

Clarify release candidate missing plan diagnostic

Make release candidate report a direct validation error and next command when the release plan directory is missing, instead of E_INTERNAL.

## Scope

- In scope: Make release candidate report a direct validation error and next command when the release plan directory is missing, instead of E_INTERNAL.
- Out of scope: unrelated refactors not required for "Clarify release candidate missing plan diagnostic".

## Plan

Update release candidate planning lookup so a missing .agentplane/.release/plan directory raises an actionable validation error with next_action 'agentplane release plan --patch' instead of E_INTERNAL. Add a focused regression test for the missing-plan case.

## Verify Steps

PLANNER fallback scaffold for "Clarify release candidate missing plan diagnostic". Replace with task-specific acceptance checks when PLANNER context is available.

1. Review the requested outcome for "Clarify release candidate missing plan diagnostic". Expected: the visible result matches ## Summary and stays inside approved scope.
2. Run the most relevant validation step for this task. Expected: it succeeds without unexpected regressions in touched behavior.
3. Compare the final result against ## Scope and record any residual follow-up in ## Findings. Expected: open edges are explicit rather than implicit.
